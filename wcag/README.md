# Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)  

**Welcome!**  
Are you ready to make the web a more inclusive place? The **Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)** provide a comprehensive framework to ensure your digital content is accessible to everyone, regardless of their abilities.  

### What is WCAG?  
WCAG is a set of internationally recognized guidelines aimed at improving accessibility for:  
- **Vision impairments**: Including blindness, partial sight, and color blindness.  
- **Hearing impairments**: Catering to those who are deaf or hard of hearing.  
- **Mobility challenges**: Supporting users who have difficulty with a mouse or keyboard.  
- **Cognitive differences**: Helping those with dyslexia, autism, or learning difficulties.  

### Why is WCAG important?  
Accessibility isn't just about complianceâ€”itâ€™s about creating equitable digital experiences. WCAG 2.2 emphasizes **Perceivable**, **Operable**, **Understandable**, and **Robust** design principles to ensure content works for everyone, regardless of their tools or technology.
