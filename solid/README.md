## üéØ What is SOLID?
SOLID is a set of **five essential principles** introduced by **Robert C. Martin (Uncle Bob)** to guide software developers in building **robust, maintainable, and scalable** systems. These principles focus on making code easier to understand and extend, reducing the risk of errors as software evolves.

### üîç Breakdown of SOLID
- **S** - **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):** Each class should have only one reason to change.
- **O** - **Open/Closed Principle (OCP):** Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.
- **L** - **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):** Subtypes should be substitutable for their base types without altering the application‚Äôs behavior.
- **I** - **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):** No client should be forced to depend on methods it does not use.
- **D** - **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):** High-level modules should depend on abstractions, not on low-level modules.

## üíª Why Use SOLID Principles?
Using SOLID principles helps to:
- **Improve Code Maintainability:** Easier to update and extend features without breaking existing functionality.
- **Enhance Readability:** Clear separation of responsibilities makes the code more understandable.
- **Promote Reusability:** Well-structured components can be easily reused in different parts of the application.
